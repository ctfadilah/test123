Project Title:  Job as a machine learning engineer is tasked to categorize
unseen products into 4 categories namely "Electronics”, "Household”,
"Books”, and “Clothing & Accessories”. 

Data from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-textclassification

The following are the criteria of the project:
1) Download the dataset and use Pandas to read and process the data.
2) Develop model using LSTM which can achieve accuracy of more
than 85% and F1 score of more than 0.7.
3) Only allowed to use TensorFlow library to develop and train the
model.
4) Plot the graph using Tensorboard.
5) Save the model in .h5 format in a folder named saved_models.
6) Save tokenizer in .json format in a folder named saved_models

What your project does?
- import packages
- Data loading
- Data inspection
- The review is the feature, the sentiment is the label
- Convert label into integers using LabelEncoder
- Data preprocessing
- Define some hyperparameter
- Perform train test split
- Perform tokenization
- Perform padding and truncating
- Model development
- Model compilation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

Any challenges you face and how you solve them? 
- Yes, the challenges that i face is to develop my own model using LSTM which can achieve accuracy of more
than 85% and F1 score of more than 0.7. Other than that, a bit confius to understand the question. But after read carefully, i can do it better.
